# Housing-Affordability-and-Debt-in-America

**Problem Identification**
Investigate the relationship between housing affordability (both in terms of rent and home value) and overall debt at a county level in the United States. We aim to understand whether counties with higher housing costs also experience elevated levels of debt, thereby providing insights into the financial challenges faced by residents in different counties.

With the ever-fluctuating real estate market and the diverse economic challenges faced by different regions, understanding the correlation between housing costs and debt can offer policymakers, financial institutions, and community organizers crucial insights. Housing is a significant expense for most households, and understanding its impact on overall financial health is pivotal.

**Conclusion**
The Tableau story point visualizations present a comprehensive look into the relationship between household income, debt trends, and housing affordability across the U.S. at both state and county levels. In the state-by-state analysis, there's a juxtaposition of average household income against debt rates. Some states, despite having high average incomes, show a significant portion of the population in debt, indicating that a higher income doesn't always correlate with lower debt. Conversely those states with the highest levels of debt almost always also have the lowest income levels.

Drilling down to the county level, the impact of debt patterns on housing affordability is evident. A chart displays the correlation between the percentage of the population with debt in collections and housing costs, emphasizing the burden of rising debt on securing housing. Simultaneously, another graph highlights the connection between medical debt's share in total collections and housing affordability, suggesting that unforeseen medical expenses can have significant repercussions on housing stability.

Finally, there's a comparison of county-level median debt in collections against Zillow’s estimated rent costs, showcasing disparities across regions. Simultaneously, another graph contrasts average household income with Zillow's home estimates, reinforcing the complex interplay between income, housing costs, and debt, which can vary widely across the U.S.
